# NOTES

## Thursday, Feb 5th, 2026

- Certain files are generated at build time (see `tool` directory and comments
  in `CMakeLists.txt`).
- We have cherry-picked specific extensions from SQLite rather than support all
  of them, presumably to reduce maintenance surface area.
- Reorganized `CMakeLists.txt` to clarify which files are stock SQLite vs.
  Comdb2-related.
